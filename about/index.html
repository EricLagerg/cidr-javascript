<h1>Subnetting Calculator</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>My subnet calculator will perform any computation on a submask, CIDR value, or IPv4 address. For example, it'll convert a submask to CIDR notation (e.g. 255.255.252.0 -> /22). Among other things, it'll also tell you the maximum number of hosts per network, the class of network, and number of subnets.<p>
<h2 id="first">How do I use it?</h2>
<p>One of two ways. The <strong>first</strong> would be to put in either your submask or CIDR number (e.g. 255.255.255.0 OR /24) and then your IP. This will fill out all fields correctly. If you just want to convert a submask to CIDR or visa versa, simply ignore the IP line. The <strong>second</strong> would be to enter the number of hosts you wish to serve (e.g. 500 or 250 or 65534) <em>in addition to</em> your IP. Again, if you don't have an IP and just want to see the submask/CIDR that your
number of hosts requires, then ignore that field.</p>

<strong>Remember</strong>If you get "NaN" or "undefined" then either you've left the IP field blank OR you've messed something up. There's not a lot of error checking -- so as long as you don't try to do something weird like use the IP "523.532.124.999", you'll be fine. It's 100% accurate. I promise.</p>
<h2>How do I use it on my website?</h2>
<p>It's simple: include the JavaScript file <a href="/src/js/master.js">"master.js"</a> on your website, and make sure you have the form/table HTML files <a href="/src/html/html.html">found here</a>.</p>
<h2>Can I use this on my own website? Or somewhere else?</h2>
<p>Yes, for the most part. The code is licensed under the MIT license, which you <a href="/license.txt">can find here</a>. For a tl;dr, you can refer to<a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license"> tldrlegal.com/l/mit</a></p>

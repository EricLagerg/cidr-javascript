<h1>Subnet Calculator</h1>
<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>My subnet calculator will perform any computation on a submask, CIDR value, or IPv4 address. For example, it'll convert a submask to CIDR notation (e.g. 255.255.252.0 -> /22). Among other things, it'll also tell you the maximum number of hosts per network, the class of network, and number of subnets.<p>
<h2>But Eric...</h2>
<h3>Why is '# Hosts' two values smaller than what it should be?</h3>
<p>Because I subtracted two because the '# Hosts' is the number of <em>valid</em> hosts. The Network ID and Broadcast ID aren't valid hosts, thus they were removed.</p>
<h3>Why don't you include the range?</h3>
<p>Because (1) I haven't added it yet, and (2) the range is Network ID -1 to Broadcast ID -1. So, a Network ID of 192.168.0.0 and a Broadcast ID of 192.168.0.255 (I made those numbers up) will have a range of 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254.</p>
<p>It'll come soon enough, but my JavaScript is a mess and cleaning will happen when I have free time<./p>
